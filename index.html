    <h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>
The world’s primary modes of transportation are facing two major problems: rising oil costs and increasing carbon emissions. As a result, electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining popularity as they are 
  independent of oil and do not produce greenhouse gases. However, despite their benefits, several operational issues still need to be addressed for EV adoption to become widespread. 
  This research delves into the evolution of EVs over time and highlights their benefits, including reducing carbon emissions and air pollution. It also explores the challenges and difficulties
  faced in their adoption, such as the high cost of infrastructure, scarcity of charging stations, limited range or range anxiety, and the performance of batteries. To overcome these challenges,
  potential solutions include enhancing the charging infrastructure, increasing the number of charging stations, using battery swapping techniques, and improving battery technology to address range
  anxiety and reduce charging times. Governments can incentivize consumers to purchase EVs through tax credits or subsidies and invest in building a robust charging infrastructure. Industry stakeholders
  can collaborate with governments to address these challenges and promote the adoption of EVs, which can contribute to reducing carbon emissions and air pollution. </p>

  3.1. Battery Degradation
A BEV is powered only by its battery pack, which can be charged from the electrical grid. In contrast, PHEVs use an internal combustion engine, an electric motor for mobility, 
  and a battery that can be charged from the power grid. BEVs and PHEVs are also called “PEVs”, which are EV varieties that can be charged using energy from the grid [49]. 
  Lithium-ion batteries are the most popular alternative for electric vehicles (EVs), followed by lead-acid, nickel-metal hydride, and sodium-nickel chloride batteries [50]. 
  Various charging levels can be used to recharge an EV’s battery. A battery requires 2–8 h to fully charge at level 1 or level 2, which is at 110–240 voltage, also known as ordinary 
  charging, but level 3 (480 V), also known as rapid charging, requires just 20 to 40 min. The expense of an EV’s battery is still significant. From up to USD800 (2012), the cost of 
  electric vehicle lithium-ion battery bundles (per kWh) is anticipated to fall to USD125 by 2022. Battery degeneration happens while the battery is stored, corresponding to annual aging, 
  and when it is charged and discharged.
The EV sector differs from the traditional ICV industry in several ways, making challenges with growing EV service operations more difficult. Below is a summary of these broad problems. <br>
  
3.2. Charging Infrastrcture
EV-related technologies are still developing; hence, their future course is yet unknown. For instance, one of the most important elements influencing EV acceptance is the battery performance, 
  which is still not at its peak. Despite recent advancements in the construction of charging infrastructure, it is still not as accessible or practical as conventional petrol stations. This can 
  make it challenging for EV drivers to locate charging outlets when needed, especially when traveling long distances or in remote places. The speed of battery recharging is another ambiguous 
  technological aspect. It has long been anticipated that fast and secure charging will let Electric vehicles replace Individually Constructed Vehicles. Global-scale fast charging would, however, 
  increase the stress on the electric grid and, as a result, pose several stability issues for power systems. Another source of misunderstanding in technical standards are those for charging interface 
  standards. Prior agreement on recharging standards will be essential for developing the EV market, as more diverse standards require more significant infrastructure expenditure. Additionally, many 
  charging standards make producing their goods more challenging for EV suppliers and automakers. </p>
