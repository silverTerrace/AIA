When Milwaukee plunged to minus 5 degrees Fahrenheit last month, the range on Don Wright's Ford F-150 Lightning fell by almost half, plummeting to 160 miles.

It's an edge case. Most days are not so frigid, even in Wisconsin.

But the situation highlights an electric vehicle pain point. Freezing weather can deplete the EV battery and slow charging times, and the U.S. doesn't have enough public chargers to give drivers confidence in finding a station when they need it.

EVs lose about 30 percent of their range on average in freezing conditions, according to a study of 18 popular models by analytics firm Recurrent. The 2021 Volkswagen ID4 lost the most power, 46 percent of its range. The 2021 and 2022 Audi e-tron lost the least, 16 percent.

Recurrent's analysis includes data from more than 10,000 vehicles across the U.S., along with tens of thousands of data points from on-board devices that provide data on energy usage.

Last month, local news outlets in Chicago reported that several Tesla drivers were stranded at a charging station. But it likely wasn't the fault of the charger. The battery cells cause the charging delay, said Charlie Parker, founder of Ratel Consulting, a battery advisory group.

In extremely cold temperatures, power moves in and out of battery cells slowly, said Wright, the Lightning owner who is vice president of engineering at battery-testing company Unico.

Data from Here Technologies backs up that thesis: The company hasn't found an abnormal increase in inoperable chargers in Chicago so far this winter.

"Vehicle battery and hardware may be contributing to reports from drivers in the area," said spokesperson Jordan Stark.

EVs also lose range in the winter because cold drivers crank up the heat to stay warm. That's a drain. EVs use energy from the battery to produce cabin heat. Gasoline powered vehicles use "waste heat" from the engine to warm the interior.

Extreme cold usually won't hurt the battery in the long run, but it will impact immediate performance, Parker said.

"The technology, even though it is mature, is not accounting for these once-a-year, twice-a-year situations," he said.

There are also "not enough chargers to go around," Parker said.

The U.S. had nearly 3 million EVs in operation as of October, according to S&P Global Mobility. There are just over 160,000 public charging ports scattered across the country, according to the Department of Energy. That's about 19 EVs for every Level 2 or fast charger.

Charging company Flo said its sessions have been slightly longer during last month's cold spell. But its overall performance has barely changed because its chargers are designed to operate in minus 40 degrees. Most of the company's team engineered and manufactured the chargers in Quebec City, said Nathan Yang, chief product officer.

Flo uses components that can operate at a wide range of temperatures. The company designed filters to ensure the snow doesn't block the chargers' air intake. The charging cords are also flexible, avoiding the rigidness that afflicts some of them in winter weather.

Still, frigid temperatures exacerbate the problem of charger reliability nationwide, Yang said.

"It's not just the hardware. It's also the software network to be able to call somebody if you have a problem," he said.

What drivers can do

There are several actions drivers can take to improve cold-weather charging.

When a battery is stressed from extreme weather, it's not able to charge as fast as usual, Parker said. Pre-conditioning can help when possible.

Slow charging on a Level 2 system, such as a home charger in a driver's garage, often works better in frigid weather than a public fast charger, Wright said, but it takes more time.

Buying an EV with a heat pump could also help, Parker said. Tesla has heat pumps on its newer models. They handle battery thermal management, heat the motor and warm the cabin. Heat pumps use less energy than typical EV heaters, which are resistive and work more like the coils of a toaster.

Recurrent suggests forgoing the cabin heater altogether. The EV data firm recommends using seat warmers and a heated steering wheel, which use less energy.

Gasoline-powered vehicles also struggle in freezing conditions. Gasoline mileage is about 15 percent lower in the freezing cold, according to the Department of Energy. But the winter wallop is an inconvenience of EV ownership, Parker said.

"It will become less of a problem over time" as battery technology improves, he said.</p>
